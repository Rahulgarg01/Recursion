# In this problem we basically calculate no. of different ways in which we can reach nth stair taking 1 or max 2 steps at a time .
# For eg: There are three ways for Reaching 3rd stair - (1,1,1) (2,1) (1,2)
# Calculation is same as fiboncci Series just base case is different

  if(n==1 || n==2){
    return n;}
  int recCall1 = countWays(Stair-1);
  int recCall2 = countWays(Stair-2);
  int smallCalc = recCall1 + recCall2;
  return smallCalc;
